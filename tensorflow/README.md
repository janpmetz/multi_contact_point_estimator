The library "lib_multi_contact_point_model.so"
is a library to load a tensorflow model file, hold it in a session and make predictions using the tensorflow core.

The model "frozen_model_three_points.pb":
is a model file that holds the learned weights and the computation graph of the neural network.

The code to train the model and compile the library is here:
